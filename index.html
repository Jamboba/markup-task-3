                        Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,
                        were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,
                        thank you very much. They were the last people you'd 
                        expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, 
                        because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
                        Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, 
                        which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, 
                        although he did have a very large mustache. 
                        Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, 
                        which came in very useful as she spent so much of her 
                        time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. 
                        The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
                        opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
                        At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
                        Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, 
                        because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
                        “Little tyke” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. 
                        It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the 
                        first sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. For a second, 
                        Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen—then he jerked his 
                        head around to look again.
                        There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive,
                        but there wasn't a map in sight
                        What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. 
                        Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back.
                        As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, 
                        he watched the cat in his mirror.
                        It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no,
                        looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. 
                        Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.
                        As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills
                         he was hoping to get that day.

                        But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.
                        As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that 
                        there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks.
                        Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes—the getups you
                        saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. 
                        He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle 
                        of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly 
                        together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young 
                        at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald 
                        green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was 
                        probably some silly stunt—these people were obviously collecting for 
                        something… yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later,
                        Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
                        Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.
                        If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.
                        He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the
                        street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
                        Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime.Mr. Dursley, however, had
                        a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. 
                        He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in
                        a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and
                        walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

                    <p>
                        He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks 
                        until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.
                        He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know 
                        why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
                        excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.
                        It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag,
                        that he caught a few words of what they were saying.

                        Sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
                        It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man 
                        was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being
                        almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into
                        a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,
                        “Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice,
                        for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should
                        be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
                        And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
                        Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger.

                        He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.
                        He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, 
                        hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before,
                        because he didn't approve of imagination.
                        As he pulled into  the driveway of number four, 
                        the first thing he saw—and it didn't improve his 
                        mood—was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. 
                        It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was 
                        the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
                        “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
